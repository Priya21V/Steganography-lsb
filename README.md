This project implements LSB Steganography in C to hide secret messages within a  BMP image.
It modifies the least significant bits of each pixel's RGB values to embed the message without noticeable image quality loss. 
The program offers both encoding (hiding the message) and decoding (extracting the hidden message) functionality. 
It ensures that the image size is adequate to store the message and gracefully handles invalid inputs.
This project demonstrates a simple and effective way to achieve covert communication using image files.
